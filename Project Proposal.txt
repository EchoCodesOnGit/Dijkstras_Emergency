Ethan Smith and Emily Monroe FIXED PROPOSAL

REAL LIFE EXAMPLE:

We will be creating a code to get the fastest route for disaster response and emergency services. We will focus primarily on Rescue Operations and Evacuation Planning. So, finding the quickest way to get to the disaster and the quickest way to get from there to a place like a hospital or just a safe location. We will be focusing on using the shortest possible path using Dijkstra's algorithm. This could be used by not only first responders, but also people planning events. Knowing the fasted evacuation route to the hospital can be the difference between life and death for somebody. Personally, I use evacuation routes all the time with military planning should the worst happen, and having an algorithm to do it for you would help reduce planning time for anyone needing a route. We would begin with the mapping of a route from UNA to the nearest hospital. We would have 3 different campus buildings as points and some of the nearby hospitals like North Alabama Medical Center and Hellen Keller hospital. The three buildings we would start with would be the Commons, Wesleyan Annex, and Flowers Hall. All of these have easy access to a road from the building, making it a good starting point. Each building would get their own map from their location to the 2 different hospitals. We would take data from Google Maps and Apple Maps.
